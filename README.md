# Stm32_Driver_Development

This project is aimed to develop the STM32f4 microcontroller peripheral drivers (GPIO,UART,SPI,I2C) from scratch without using any third party library. After the driver development some tasks are done to check the feasibilty and applicability of the drivers.This project can be used as a template for driver developments.
